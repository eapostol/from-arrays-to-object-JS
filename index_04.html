    <title>How Arrays Evolved into Objects - Part 04: Creating ES5 "Objects"</title>
    <script>
        // So how can someone create "real" objects in JavaScript?
        // well, here is *one* technique. Note that there are multiple "techniques" in the ES5 JavaScript world.
        // Choosing one is a matter of taste, and who you are working with - performance wise, it may have practical
        // implications, but you can check that out for yourself.

        /* A 'canonical' method of creating objects from scratch is to use the function as an object.
        *   Create a function as follows: */
        function Person( name, height, age, weight ) {
                // notice the usage of the word 'this'. this means -this...object (which is a 'Person')-
                this.name = name;
                this.height = height;
                this.age = age;
                this.weight = weight;
                this.jump = function(howHigh){
                    alert(this.name + ' has jumped ' + howHigh + ' meters high!');
                }
        }

        /* Once you create a function, you can create a new instance of it like so. Notice the usage of the word 'new'
        *   here, as in 'I am creating an instance of a -new- Person, with these parameters ...*/
        var personOne = new Person('Edward',181,35,190);
        var personTwo = new Person('Michelle',170,33,150); // it looks pretty readable.

        /* After you have created the Person object, you can use the -instance- of the Person object like so */
        console.log("Person One's name is " + personOne.name);
        console.log("Person Two's name is " + personTwo.name + " she is " + personTwo.age + " years old ");

        // onClick of the document, let's make personOne 'jump'
        window.addEventListener("click", function() { personOne.jump(35) }  );
        /* kinda cheating here - in the above statement, I said 'listen to the click event of the window, and run
        *   a function that will tell personOne to Jump 35 whatever units...*/

        // now, making instances of people 'looks' easier.
        var hereIsAnArrayofPeopleWithData = [
            ['Edward', 181, 35, 190 ],
            ['Sam', 170, 34, 201 ],
            ['Tyler', 191, 47, 185 ],
            ['Jane', 170, 37, 145, ]
        ];
        var counter1 = 0;
        var allPeople = [];
        for (counter1; counter1 < hereIsAnArrayofPeopleWithData.length; counter1++){
            var tempPerson = new Person(); // notice I didn't fill in any values. so this person has null values for
            // it's properties, as well as a jump() method)
            tempPerson.name = hereIsAnArrayofPeopleWithData[counter1][0];
            tempPerson.height = hereIsAnArrayofPeopleWithData[counter1][1];
            tempPerson.age = hereIsAnArrayofPeopleWithData[counter1][2];
            tempPerson.weight = hereIsAnArrayofPeopleWithData[counter1][3];
            allPeople.push(tempPerson); // add the temporary person to the allPeople array, and loop around again.
        }

        // now let's find out some information about the people!
        console.log(allPeople); // print out all the people
        var firstPerson = allPeople[0]; // let's get the first person
        var secondPerson = allPeople[1];


        console.log('the first person is ' + firstPerson.name ); // easy peasy! you can also do firstPerson['name']
        console.log('the second person is ' + secondPerson.name);

        // due to the origins of objects as just arrays with labels for the index values.
        /* let's make the first person jump , onClick of that button that was in the body of the document...
        // notice I did NOT use an onclick attribute in the HTML tag for the button, I wrote code in Javascript
        // that told the button to listen to it's click event!
        */
        document.addEventListener("load", function()
                            {
                            theButton.addEventListener("click", function()
                                                                {
                                                                    firstPerson.jump(25) ;
                                                                } );
                            } );

        /* Note that the above technique is written kinda messy. You'll get used to it with enough exploration
        * of JQuery lol . There are neater ways to write this (like refactoring the functions) but that is another
        * story...  AND THERE YOU HAVE IT */
